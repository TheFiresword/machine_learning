The objective of this project is to understand the factors determining `landing outcome` of space 
X falcon 9 rockets. To do so, a dataset was constructed using information provided by `Space X`
itself through  its API, but also from Wikipedia website. The data was cleaned, treated, and 
analyzed using tools like `pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and scikit-learn`.

Key findings include:
- Determining factors of the outcome, include Flight number, Launch Site, Payload Mass (kg) and Booster version.

- The `Kennedy Space Center (KSC LC-39A) in Florida` site is the most used for falcon 9 launches ( `41,7%`)

- But this site is also the one with the high success launches rate (`76,9%`).

- As the `flight number` increases, the `success rate` increases too.

- Trained `machine learning models` produced a relatively high `accuracy` (about `83,33%`) for predicting the outcome of new attempts of rocket landing.

Overall, this analysis provided information about how to choose the best parameters to have the 
highest probabilities of launch success and landing success.
