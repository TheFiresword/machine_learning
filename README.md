# Machine learning projects

Each directory represents a project, and each projects implements some machine learning, deep learning, or basics AI algorithms.
Those projects are from the EdX course : [https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python?index=product&queryID=43fc73c60b56b2884f7b2745e1e50062&position=2&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete)
